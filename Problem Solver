  Have you ever thought, “a regular gun just really doesn’t do the trick anymore”? Well you are in luck because there has been a new discovery in London that might just be exactly what people like you are looking for. For those that need a little more than just a couple bullets, an artillery officer has discovered a marvelous invention of a quick-firing gun which is capable of firing 600 shots per minute. And if that is not for you, which I don’t see how, the bullets are fired over a radius of about 160 degrees. This death-dealing weapon will probably solve any of your day to day problems especially because with this weapon alone you could probably take out a small town or an entire army.
